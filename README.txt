File list:
1)QWalk0-1-0-Feb17.py - 1D quantum walk simulations, contains all three initial conditions which can be selected by uncommenting/commenting
2)QWalk_theoretical3_0_1_0.py - 1D quantum walk comparison of simulation and analytical integration

3)Plotter_Output.py - Used to plot simulation results with LaTEX formatting
4)Plotter_Errors.py - Used to plot error-behaviour with LaTEX formatting

5)QWalk0-2-1-Apr14.py - 2D quantum walk with a Hadamard coin for multiple initial conditions selected by uncommenting/commenting
6)QWalk0-2-2-Apr14.py - 2D quantum walk with a Grover coin, (rest same as above)
7)QWalk0-2-3-Apr14.py - 2D quantum walk with a Fourier coin, (rest same as above)

(Data files for plotting)

8)Error-checker-Biased-Sim-analytic-N=50.dat - Generated by QWalk_theoretical3_0_1_0.py, contains error and probability behaviour
9)QWalkSimulation(N=100),left-biased.dat - Simulation output, 1D quantum walk
10)QWalkSimulation(N=100),right-biased.dat - Same as above
11)QWalkSimulation(N=100),symmetric.dat - Same as above
